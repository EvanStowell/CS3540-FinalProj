## Description
Predicting player awards for the current 2025 NFL season using ML models

## Awards
NFL Honors awards are decided by a panel of 50 sports journalists, independent from the league. Voting is overseen by the Associated Press (AP).
The major titles include:
- NFL MVP
- Offensive Player of the Year (OPOY)
- Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY)
- Offensive Rookie of the Year (OROY)
- Defensive Rookie of the Year (DROY)
- Coach of the Year

## Voting Process
For the MVP award, panelists submit their top five players using a 10-5-3-2-1 point system. For other awrds, it is a 5-3-1 point system.

## Research Questions
### EDA
- How much greater are award winners than the average player in their position?
- Are award winners typically on Super Bowl winning teams?

### Experiment
- How accurately can we predict award winners for any given season?
- What features are most important in winning each award?

### Conclusions
- How much does media/narrative impact voting?
